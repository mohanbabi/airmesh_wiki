Ground Control Station Setup
============================

There are two major types of Ground Control Stations (GCS) commonly in use:

1. **Mission Planner**
2. **QGroundControl Station**

This guide explains how to connect your Flight Controller to a Ground Control Station over a cellular network for daily operations.

**Power on your Flight Control System**

1. **Join the Tailscale Network:**

   - Ensure your monitoring device (laptop or mobile) is connected to the Tailscale VPN network with a valid data connection.
   - Your Airmesh system and the laptop or mobile device will have separate networks but should be in the same VPN network (Tailscale network).
   - Verify connectivity:
      - Use the `ping` command to check the IP address of the drone. If the ping is successful, you are ready to proceed.
      - If the ping response is not successful, check if:
         - A valid data pack is available.
         - The system is powered on correctly.
   - Open the Ground Control Station software (Mission Planner or QGroundControl Station).

2. **Connect the Ground Control Station to the Flight Controller:**

   - To connect the Ground Control Station (GCS) to the Flight Controller:
      - Enter the **IP address** and **port** in the connection options of the Ground Control Station software.
      - Click on **Connect**. The GCS will start displaying real-time flight data.
   - **Note:** Ensure the IP and port match the settings of your Airmesh system.
   - Refer to the reference video below for detailed instructions.

3. **Test Flight:**

   - Conduct a test flight to ensure proper connectivity and control.
   - Verify telemetry and commands are functioning as expected.
